              umm, tsogt is a furry, i mean he says he wants to have intercourse
              with wolves and he's sexualizing canines, which are the
              fundamental principles of a furry "enthusiast".
            </p>
            <p>
              not to mention the countless number of times he has shown his
              indifference to <i>exotic</i> content
            </p>
            <p>
              to say tsogt isn't weird would be to say nothing, but no one is
              flawless, so what else do i have on him?
            </p>

              tsogt has repeatedly shown his <i>"interest"</i> for anime, and
              doesn't shy from letting us know it. for instance, Tsogt has shown
              an <i>"appreciation"</i> for a particular Naruto character, I
              believe it was Hinata or something, and how he views her as
              sexually attractive.
            </p>
            <p>
              normally this is acceptable but no it is not, and as a resident
              snowflake tasked with gatekeeping humor, i shall not stand for
              this.

              On top of this, Tsogt has shown a sus interest in media depicting
              sexual activities, the furry community are notorious for such
              actions.

                Tsogt has openly stated that he found this scene "stimulating"
                and that he derives joy from viewing this scene. Throughout the
                entire movie, Tsogt had peaked my interest in how he composed
                himself during and after the movie had started playing. He would
                often jabber about his predictions of the plot and his views on
                which character he was similar to. This proves that Tsogt
                enjoyed the movie, but that's not my goal.

                  <b>Regression into primitive and archaic instincts</b>
                </h3>
                Over half of all furries have had interest into a form of sexual
                content known as "yiff". "Yiffing" is a term that describes
                fictional (sometimes cartoonish) animals, known as fursonas by
                the furry community, having intercourse with each other, this
                form of cross-breeding is greatly frowned upon by society and is
                a form of "de-evolution".
                <br />
                Tsogt has openly stated in a recent interview that he did indeed
                view the characters as attractive and wanted to have cotitus
                with them.
