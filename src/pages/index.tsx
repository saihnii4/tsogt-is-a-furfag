              umm, tsogt is a furry, i mean he says he wants to have intercourse
              with wolves and he's sexualizing canines, which are the
              fundamental principles of a furry "enthusiast".
            </p>
            <p>
              not to mention the countless number of times he has shown his
              indifference to <i>exotic</i> content
            </p>
            <p>
              to say tsogt isn't weird would be to say nothing, but no one is
              flawless, so what else do i have on him?
            </p>

            <p>
              tsogt has repeatedly shown his <i>"interest"</i> for anime, and
              doesn't shy from letting us know it. for instance, Tsogt has shown
              an <i>"appreciation"</i> for a particular Naruto character, I
              believe it was Hinata or something, and how he views her as
              sexually attractive.
            </p>
            <p>
              normally this is acceptable but no it is not, and as a resident
              snowflake tasked with gatekeeping humor, i shall not stand for
              this.
            </p>
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            <p>
              On top of this, Tsogt has shown a sus interest in media depicting
              sexual activities, the furry community are notorious for such
              actions.
